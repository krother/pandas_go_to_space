# Beakonomics

The goal of this exercise is to create a short data report.
Use the `penguins` dataset in `seaborn`:

    :::python3
    import seaborn as sns

    df = sns.load_dataset('penguins')
   
Explore the data to answer four questions about the beaks of Penguins:

1. How does a typical penguin beak look like?
2. What is the distribution of beak lengths and widths for different species?
3. Which species have long and slim beaks, which are rather short and wide?
4. Are the beak sizes in the most prevalent species correlated with any other feature of a penguin?

Answer each question with a diagram and formulate a textual answer (1-2 sentences).
Decide on your own what kind of plot answers the question best.
If necessary, reshape or normalize the data.
