   Long long ago, in a galaxy far far away,
   there lived pandas traveling space.
   They were peaceful explorers and skilled data scientists.
   The pandas would venture to the stars in their spaceships
   to discover planets full of data,
   to analyze and plot that data,
   and find new tastes of bamboo no creature had tasted before.

This is a Python tutorial featuring the `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ library.
It focuses on the technical basics of Data Science – working with tabular data.
On the way, you will help the pandas explore space.
