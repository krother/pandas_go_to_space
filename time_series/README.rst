Reactor Trouble
---------------

.. card::
   :shadow: lg

   **Alert!** The anti-matter reactor of the ship has become unstable.
   High-energy particles start drifting in random directions.
   As it is the matter with anti-matter, it might easily turn your ship into a fireball if the particle displacement becomes too large.
   
   Fortunately your engineers say this should be easy to fix.
   All you need to do is to measure the displacement over time and recalibrate the reactor.

   Here is the data:
   
   .. code:: ipython3

      import numpy as np

      displacement = np.random.normal(size=200)

Create a Time Series
--------------------

Handling timestamps is one of the strongest features in ``pandas``.
Most of the time, you will want the timestamps to be in the **row index**.
With :py:func:`pandas.date_range` you can create series of timestamps from scratch:

.. code:: ipython3

    import pandas as pd

    s = pd.Series(
        data = displacement,
        index = pd.date_range("2023-03-09", freq="D", periods=200),
        name = "reactor_temp",
    )
    s.head()

Instead of a ``pd.Series`` object you could also use a DataFrame, allowing for multiple columns.
In both cases, a ``pandas.DateTimeIndex`` is used to track data over time.


You could also create timestamps specifying both boundaries and a number of periods:

.. code:: ipython3

    pd.date_range("2023-03-09 08:22:00", "2023-03-09 16:00:00", periods=200),

----

Timestamps from Strings
-----------------------

Parsing strings to timestamps is very convenient.
``pandas`` understands plenty of different formats.
This makes your life much easier, e.g. when parsing the log files of an anti-matter reactor.

.. code:: ipython3

    pd.to_datetime(
        ["2020", "September 16th, 2020", "2020 Sep 16 11:11", "2020/09/16", "09/16/2020"],
        day_first=False
    )

Technically, the timestamps are stored in integers and measured in nanoseconds since the **Unix epoch on Jan 1st, 1970** when the first Unix machine officially started to tick.

.. note::

   When reading timestamp columns from a CSV file, the option ``parse_dates=True`` is a useful shortcut if the timestamp is the index. Otherwise ``parse_dates=['col_name']`` works as well.

----

Plotting Time Series
--------------------

When plotting a time series, ``pandas`` automatically uses the time index for the x-axis:

.. code:: ipython3

    s.plot()

.. image:: random.png

A frequently used trick is to sum up values with a **cumulative sum**.
The **random data** becomes a **random walk**.
You see that the small changes add up over time and the data is drifting.
Note that the resulting data still has a similar timestamp index:

.. code:: ipython3

    ts = s.cumsum()
    ts.plot()

``pandas`` decides on the fly whiich scale and which ticks to use for the x-axis.
This works well almost all the time:

.. image:: walk.png

----

Accessing DateTime Attributes
-----------------------------

Every **DateTimeIndex** has a couple of useful fields that can be accessed:

.. code:: python3


    ts.index.year
    ts.index.month
    ts.index.hour
    ts.index.weekday
    ts.index.minute
    ts.index.month_name()
    ts.index.day_name()

----

Indexing and Slicing
--------------------

Timestamp indexes can be indexed and sliced comfortably using string intervals:

.. code:: ipython3

    ts['1/10/2011']
    ts["2023-03-20":"2023-04-17"]
    ts[datetime(2011, 1, 7):]
    ts['1/6/2011':'1/11/2011']

----

Resampling
----------

A frequent task is changing rows so that different intervals between the time stamps are used.
There are two types of resampling.

**Downsampling** condenses the data (fewer rows).
Like with ``df.groupby()``, you need to specify, how the rows should be aggregated:

.. code:: python3

    ts.resample("1M").mean()
    ts.resample("2W").sum()
    ts.resample("10d").first()

**Upsampling** changes the index to a wider timescale (more rows).
The resulting gaps need to be filled or interpolated, otherwise they stay empty:

.. code:: ipython3

    ts.resample("6h10min").first()
    ts.resample("6h10min3s").ffill()
    ts.resample("6h").first().interpolate()

----

Rolling Mean
------------

A frequent type of aggregation is the **rolling mean** (or moving average).
It shifts a window of N data points over the time series and returns a value for each position.
This smoothes out noise in the data.

.. code:: python3

    ts.rolling(window=10).mean()
    ts.rolling(window=10).std()
    
    ts.rolling(window=10).mean().plot()

Try different window sizes and see how the curve becomes smoother and smoother.
``.rolling()`` also works for rolling standard deviations and custom functions.
