Diplomacy
---------

.. card::
   :shadow: lg

   You finally make direct contact with the space penguins.
   Their delegates meet yours. All of you have brushed your fur diligently and bring the tastiest bamboo leaves as a gift of friendship.
   When you board the penguins' ship, the meeting is a bit frosty.
   First, they iced the floor and your diplomats slip and roll around a couple of times.
   Next, upon seeing your gift the penguins hand you a slimy, smelly object.

   **You can't think of anything more rude! Is this a provocation? Is peace in the galaxy at stake?**

   Then the head of the penguin delegation starts to speak:

   .. code::

      pokHaELlRlnoXprrr purSAtfrQADnLgXeCprrr pukCprpEaAmtcuprZeSSEprrr
      pokwzIITihFprrr plofIUuRkprrr plosztnOfPhprrr prtWrEhprrr

   Your translation computer quickly starts analyzes the penguin language.
   Let's find out what the penguins have to say.

----

Tokenization
------------

Let's feed the entire message into pandas:

.. code:: python

   text = """pokhrEYLMLAohprrr ploWdoBRKledYprrr"""
   df = pd.DataFrame({'text': [text]})

You should have a ``DataFrame`` with a single row that contains the entire text.
Let's split the text into words.
The ``.str`` attribute of a ``pd.Series`` gives you an access point to Python string functions:

.. code:: python

   words = df["text"].str.split()

Having a list inside a ``pd.Series`` is not too easy to read.
It is better to unfold every word into a single row:

.. code:: python

   s = words.explode()

And convert the resulting Series to a nicely indexed ``DataFrame``:

.. code:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame({"words": s}).reset_index(drop=True)

----

Slicing Strings
---------------

Your translation computer found out that every word starts with a **glacial phoneme**.
These are any of the syllables *"plo", "pok", "pur", "prt"* or *"puk"* describing the current temperature. Because your life support keeps temperature constant, you can ignore these for now.

Let's remove the first three characters.
We can use ``.str`` to do slicing:

.. code:: python

   df["words"].str[3:]

Every word ends with the syllable *"prrr"*, and **arctic morpheme** which means something like *"it's cold here"*. This is obvious and can be ignored as well.

Every second character is a *prosodial psychronic phoneme* which is quite important in a conversation with other penguins, but in interstellar diplomacy we can leave it out as well.

Use the expression

.. code:: python
   
   df["words"].str[start:end:step]
   
to get rid of all the morphemes and phonemes.
Assign the result to a new column.

----

Case Conversion
---------------

Words in the penguin language consist of a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.
The case indicates how much the speaker is freezing (lowercase=a little, uppercase=a lot).
The methods ``.str.upper()`` and ``.str.lower()`` allow to change case for an entire string column:

.. code:: python
   
   df["words"].str.lower()

Because of our fur, the cold doesn't affect us that much.
Convert to everything to lower case.

----

Join Words
----------

Once the computer is done translating all the words, you might want to put them into a single piece of text again.
Because Python can iterate over columns of a DataFrame, you can use the normal `.join()` method of a string:

.. code:: python
   
    " ".join(df["words"])

----

Word Length
-----------

For a deeper scientific analysis of the penguin language, the word length might be useful:

.. code:: python

   df["words"].str.len()

----

String Search
-------------

Strings in pandas columns can be searched with **Regular Expressions**.
You can use the ``.findall()`` function and pattern syntax from the ``re`` module:

.. code:: python

   import re

   df['words'].str.findall(r'h.e.l.l.o', re.IGNORECASE)

----

Translate Back
--------------

It is time to respond the penguin delegation.
Your translation computer has developed an algorithm that translates panda language back to penguin language:

.. code:: python

   from random import choice
   
   def random_char_gen():
       while True:
           yield choice(string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase)
               
   def translate_pan_to_peng(word):
       chars = ""
       for a, b in zip(word, random_char_gen()):
           chars += choice([a.lower, a.upper])()
           chars += b
       prefix = choice(["plo", "pok", "pur", "prt", "puk"])
       postfix = 'prrr'
       return prefix + chars + postfix
   
   words = [translate_pan_to_peng(w) for w in message.split()]
   translated = ' '.join(words)
